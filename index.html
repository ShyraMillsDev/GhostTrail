  Your heartbeat is thunder. The cold steel stings your palms, but you don't let go.

  That sound…  
  The *snap* still echoes in the dark — not from the walls,  
  but from **inside** every breath around you.

  Someone else is breathing fast now. Not the thing.  
  One of *them*.

  A soft cry breaks the silence. Another breath catches in a throat.  
  You hear a body shifting — sliding back against the far corner.  
  Then a hiss. Words. From someone close.

  > “Who did that…?”

  You don’t answer.  
  You can’t.

  The air feels tighter. Heavier. Like the trailer is holding its breath.

  *CLANG.*

  The far end of the trailer explodes in noise.  
  A violent slam.  
  The metal groans under the force, screeching like a dying animal.  
  You drop to your knees as the entire structure rocks — not tipping, but ***buckling***.  
  A scream bursts through the dark — raw and desperate.

  Then —  
  *CRUNCH.*

  Wet. Sudden.  
  Final.

  The scream dies in a *snap*, and something slides down the wall like a sack of meat.

  Silence slams down.  
  But it’s not empty.

  It’s waiting.

  Someone whispers — harsh and cracked:

  > “It’s your fault...”

  Then another voice, louder now —  
  strangled with terror and rage.

  > “They touched the latch! I heard it! It was them!”

  You try to crawl backward, but the trailer isn’t just echoing now.  
  It’s listening.

  You’ve become a sound. A scent.  
  A ripple of heat in a cold, dead space.

  Every shift you make,  
  every breath you hold,  
  is a map.

  And now, both the survivors —  
  and the thing moving in the dark —  
  are following it.

  You didn’t just make a mistake.

  You made a sacrifice.

  You just don’t know if it was yours.`);
      break;
    case "B":
       printFast(`You don’t move.  
      Not even a breath.

      The trailer sways, groaning like something trying not to scream.  
      You press your back into the cold ribbed wall, become part of it,  
      as if metal will claim you and hide you from the thing inside here with you.

      Your body begs to move.  
      Your muscles tremble.  
      But you crush every instinct, every reflex, and bury it under raw fear.

      You are no longer a person.  
      You are noise.  
      You are scent.  
      You are prey pretending to be **part of the dark**.

      Then it happens —  
      just beside you.

      A presence glides past your foot.  
      It brushes your boot with something that feels  
      wet  
      rubbery  
      and wrong.

      You bite your lip so hard you taste copper.  
      It’s the only proof you’re still real.

      A sound breaks behind you —  
      the shallow *hic* of a stifled sob.  
      Someone else.

      You want to scream — not to warn them —  
      but to **shut them up.**  
      To stop what’s coming.

      You don’t.

      They shift.  
      A boot scuffs the metal floor.  
      A zipper is tugged — fast, nervous.  
      A whisper:

      > “Please…”

      Too late.

      You hear it  
      turn.  
      Sniff.

      Then it **moves.**

      Fast.

      A crash of limbs, metal, and skin —  
      not yours —  
      theirs.

      A scream starts.  
      It gurgles.  
      Then ends in a sound that makes you clamp your hand over your mouth and retch in silence.

      A dragging.  
      The slow, wet pull of something heavy  
      being taken  
      somewhere else.

      Then silence.

      You are still alive.

      But you know the cost.

      That sound — the scuff, the sob, the zipper —  
      **that was supposed to be yours.**

      But it wasn’t.

      > And now the only thing louder than the silence  
      > is the part of you that knows  
      > you didn’t save them.

      You just didn’t move.`);
      break;
    case "C":
      runWithTimer(`You slam your fists against the trailer wall.

      The metal erupts under your hands, the sound screaming louder than your voice.  
      You yell until your throat splits.

      > “HEY! HEY! HELP! WE’RE IN HERE!”

      Your voice fractures.  
      Blood creeps up the back of your tongue.  
      But you scream again.

      A flicker of light cuts through one of the vents — a passing headlight, maybe.  
      Your heart leaps.

      Then it’s gone.

      And so is the silence.

      ---

      Something in the trailer **changes.**  
      Not a movement — a **mood.**

      The air grows frantic.  
      Thick.  
      Breathless.

      You hear rustling.  
      A body scrambling across the floor.  
      A hissed voice:

      > “What did you do…?”

      Another whisper — far off:

      > “They heard us…”

      Then chaos.

      Someone throws themselves at the wall behind you, pounding, shrieking.  
      Another voice cries out — not in fear — in rage.

      > “YOU’VE KILLED US!”

      The trailer erupts.

      Screams — dozens — all tangled and shrill.  
      Fists slam steel.  
      Boots stomp blindly.

      You can’t tell if it’s panic or a riot.

      A hand claws your jacket. Another grabs your ankle.  
      You’re dragged to the side as people trample each other in blind desperation.

      Then it answers.

      Not the driver.  
      Not a savior.

      The thing.

      It doesn’t roar.  
      It doesn’t growl.

      It **tears.**

      Flesh from steel.  
      Bone from screams.

      A wet *impact* — close.  
      A body slams into your back.  
      You feel the warmth soak through your shirt.  
      It’s not yours.

      Yet.

      Someone screams your name — you don’t recognize the voice.  
      You don’t even remember telling them who you are.

      You open your mouth to say something. Anything.

      But now,  
      your voice doesn’t belong to you anymore.

      > It belongs to the sound you brought into the trailer.  
      > It belongs to the thing that doesn’t stop moving.  
      > That doesn’t stop *eating.*

      You didn’t call for help.

      You called for **feast.**`);
      break;
    case "D":
       printFast(`You crawl forward, palms skimming the freezing steel —  
      but it’s not clean.

      It’s **coated**.  
      Thick. Wet. Sticky.

      Your fingertips slide through it like oil mixed with ground meat.  
      The smell hits next.  
      Sweet.  
      Rotten.  
      Coppery.

      You try not to gag.

      You don’t call out.  
      You just reach.

      One hand in front of the other.

      You slice your finger on glass.  
      Crack your knee on a bolt.  
      You barely feel it anymore — the pain is background now. White noise.

      Then—  
      your hand closes around something solid.

      Cold.  
      Rough.  
      A broken metal pipe — jagged on one end, flat on the other.

      It’s heavier than it should be.  
      You don’t think about that.  
      You just grip it tighter.

      Then—

      A hand grabs your wrist.

      Tight.  
      Shaking.  
      Human.

      You jerk back instinctively — but they don’t let go.

      A voice — barely a whisper — gasps in your ear.

      > “Don’t leave me… please…”

      It’s not a threat.  
      It’s a plea.

      They’re not dragging you.  
      They’re holding on.

      Needing you.

      > But you don’t know them.  
      > You can’t see their face.  
      > You don’t even know if they’re bleeding… or bait.

      You panic.

      You pull harder — but they don’t let go.  
      Their grip tightens.

      > “Wait—”

      Your body reacts before your mind can stop it.

      You swing.

      Hard.

      The metal pipe slams into something soft.  
      You feel it *give*.  
      Not break.  
      **Collapse.**

      There’s a sound —  
      wet, thick, like biting into overripe fruit.

      Then stillness.

      No breath.

      Just a twitch.

      Then… nothing.

      The silence after is *not empty*.  
      It’s full.

      Full of something watching.

      Waiting.

      You shuffle backward, breath shaking, hands trembling.  
      The pipe is still in your grip.

      It’s warm now.

      Thicker.

      You wipe it without looking.

      You can’t.

      You don’t want to know.

      But the blood knows you.

      And so does the thing in the trailer.

      Because the moment you made the kill —  
      **it stopped.**

      Not moving.

      Just listening.

      To you.

      > You didn’t find a weapon.  
      > You found your first kill.  
      > And you still don’t know what — or who — it was.`);
